This is a report based on a questionaire conducted by This Ability Trust on the perception of people on people with disabilities. It seeks to know the views of the people as per the rights of disabled people with regards to family, sex life and work. 
The dataset contains two types of data. 
  1. The yes no type of questions.
  2. Prose questions in terms of explaining the reason behind a Yes or No.
I have created two more datasets, want and reasons. The want dataset contains the categorical columns of Yes and No or Comfortable/ Uncomfortable. 
The reasons Data set contains the prose answers with reasons for or against an opinion. In addition to that, I have analysed one column (Question 7 reasons) To check the most occurring words with more that 5 letters. During data entry, there are words, phrases that I noted to be common, I have also looked at the frequency of occurresnce.

As for the categorical data, I intend to convert the comfortable to 1 and uncomfortable to 0 and also the Yes to 1 and No to zero, so that I can try and model. I intend on using decision trees as well as logistic regression. However the data is a little messed up and imbalaced with some columns having an overwhelming Yes biased against the NOs.
